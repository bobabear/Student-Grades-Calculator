# Student Grades Calculator

A Java-based grade‚Äêprocessing toolkit that:

- Computes a student‚Äôs total weighted score (with category drops/averaging).  
- Assigns a final letter grade based on the computed score.  
- Provides both an interactive driver (`GradeChecker`) and a batch/aggregating driver (`GradeChecker2` + `Gradebook`) to compute min, max, median, and average across multiple students.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Java SE Development Kit (JDK)¬†8 or newer  
- A terminal or command prompt

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

1. **Navigate** to the `src` directory:

   ```bash
   cd Student-Grades-Calculator-main/Beta_PA3/src
   ```
2. **Compile** all .java files:<br>

   javac *.java

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. GradeChecker (Interactive)
- Without a file (prompts you to type each value):<br>

   ```bash
   java GradeChecker
   ```
- java GradeChecker With a file (reads all inputs from grades.txt or your own file):<br>
   ```bash
   java GradeChecker grades.txt
   ```

**Input Format**

  1. Student name (String)
  2. G# (String)
  3. Participation (double, 0‚Äì100)
  4. Readings (comma‚Äëseparated list of doubles, out of 100)
  5. Labs (comma‚Äëseparated list of doubles)
  6. Exercises (comma‚Äëseparated list of doubles)
  7. Projects (comma‚Äëseparated list of doubles)
  8. Midterm (double)
  9. Final exam (double)

**GradeChecker2 + Gradebook (Batch + Summary)**

This driver:
- Runs the same prompts as GradeChecker,
- Then adds the resulting StudentGrades to a Gradebook,
- Prints the individual student‚Äôs details and the gradebook summary: Min, Median, Average, Max.

  ```bash
  # Interactive mode
  java GradeChecker2
  
  # File mode
  java GradeChecker2 grades.txt
  ```

**Sample**

  ```bash
  $ java GradeChecker grades.txt

## ‚úÖ Testing
You can craft your own input files following the Input Format above. There is no built‚Äëin test harness, but you can:

1. Make copies of grades.txt with different values.
2. Run GradeChecker or GradeChecker2 against each file.
3. Verify the printed totals and letter grades match your expectations.
